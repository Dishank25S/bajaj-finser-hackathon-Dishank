# Enhanced AI Training Data Management System

## Overview
This system allows you to easily add new training data to enhance the AI chatbot's knowledge and responses. The AI now features intelligent fallback responses and enhanced user guidance when it cannot answer specific queries.

## üöÄ New Enhanced Features

### Smart Fallback Response System
When the AI cannot answer a query, it now provides:
- **Context-aware suggestions** based on query type
- **Structured guidance** with relevant sample questions
- **Professional, helpful responses** instead of generic "I don't know" messages
- **Query refinement tips** to help users get better results

### Example Enhanced Fallback Response:
```
I don't have specific stock price information for your query. However, I can help you with:

üìà **Stock Analysis I Can Provide:**
‚Ä¢ Historical price trends and patterns
‚Ä¢ Highest/lowest prices in specific periods
‚Ä¢ Price performance comparisons
‚Ä¢ Trading volume analysis

**Try asking:** 'What was the highest stock price in 2024?' or 'Show me price trends for the last quarter'
```

## üí° Enhanced AI Response Features

### Intelligent Fallback Responses
The AI now provides smart, context-aware responses when it cannot answer specific queries:

#### Query-Specific Guidance:
- **Stock Price Queries**: Suggests historical analysis options and available data periods
- **Financial Metrics**: Recommends specific performance indicators and timeframes
- **Insurance Business**: Guides users to BAGIC/BALIC specific insights
- **Comparisons**: Suggests types of comparisons available in the dataset

#### Professional Response Format:
```
Response Structure:
‚Ä¢ Clear explanation of why the specific query cannot be answered
‚Ä¢ Structured list of available alternatives with emojis for visual appeal
‚Ä¢ Specific example questions the user can try
‚Ä¢ Professional, helpful tone throughout
```

### New Training Data Added:
- **Extended Stock Data**: `BFS_Share_Price_Latest.csv` - Stock prices through July 2025
- **Quarterly Results**: `bajaj_finserv_quarterly_results.csv` - 5+ years of financial performance
- **Business Overview**: `bajaj_finserv_business_overview.json` - Comprehensive company data
- **Complete Transcripts**: Enhanced Q1 and Q2 FY25 earnings call transcripts
- **Peer Comparison**: `financial_sector_peer_comparison.csv` - Industry benchmark data

### Testing Enhanced Responses:
Try these sample queries to test the enhanced fallback system:
1. "What will the stock price be next month?" (Future prediction - should trigger fallback)
2. "Tell me about cryptocurrency" (Out of scope - should provide guidance)
3. "How is the company doing?" (Vague query - should suggest specific metrics)

## How to Add New Training Data

### Method 1: Direct File Addition

1. **Add files to the data directory:**
   ```
   server/data/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BFS_Share_Price.csv (existing)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ earnings_transcript.txt (existing)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NEW_DATA_FILE.csv (your new file)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NEW_TRANSCRIPT.txt (your new file)
   ```

2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **The AI will automatically detect and process new files**

### Method 2: API-Based Training (Advanced)

Add an endpoint to retrain the AI without restart:

```javascript
// POST /api/retrain
// Body: { dataPath: "path/to/new/data" }
```

## Training Data Guidelines

### Best Practices:

1. **Use consistent naming conventions**
2. **Include date/quarter information in filenames**
3. **Keep files organized by type**
4. **Use clear, descriptive content**
5. **Include financial metrics with units**

### Data Quality Tips:

1. **Be specific with numbers:**
   - ‚úÖ "Revenue increased by 15% to Rs. 5,000 crores"
   - ‚ùå "Revenue went up significantly"

2. **Include context:**

## Automatic Processing

The AI system automatically:

1. **Detects new files** on server startup
2. **Categorizes data** by type and content
3. **Extracts insights** from financial information
4. **Builds knowledge graphs** for relationships
5. **Creates semantic embeddings** for similarity matching

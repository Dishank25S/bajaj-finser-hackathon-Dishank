# Netlify Deployment Guide for Bajaj Finserv AI Chatbot

## 🎯 **Deployment Strategy**

### **Option 1: Netlify + Serverless Functions (Recommended)**
- ✅ Frontend on Netlify
- ✅ Backend as Netlify Functions
- ✅ AI responses via serverless functions
- ✅ Real data embedded in functions

### **Option 2: Split Deployment**
- Frontend: Netlify
- Backend: Railway/Render/Vercel
- API calls between services

### **Option 3: Full Static (Fastest)**
- Convert to pure frontend app
- Embed AI responses in React
- No backend needed

## 🚀 **Let's Set Up Option 1**

### **Step 1: Netlify Functions Setup**
We'll convert your Python AI logic to JavaScript functions that can run on Netlify.

### **Step 2: Frontend Configuration**
Update API calls to use Netlify function endpoints.

### **Step 3: Real Data Embedding**
Include your Bajaj Finserv transcript data directly in the functions.

### **Step 4: Deploy**
Push to GitHub and connect to Netlify.

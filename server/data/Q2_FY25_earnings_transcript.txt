Our stake in Bajaj Finance continues to be a significant value driver. Bajaj Finance reported an AUM of ₹3.12 lakh crores as of September 2024, up 28% YoY. The company added 1.89 crore new customers during the quarter, taking the total customer base to 7.83 crores.

The credit loss provisions at Bajaj Finance normalized to 1.35% of AUM, down from 1.42% in Q1 FY25, indicating improving asset quality and collection efficiency.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES:

Digital Transformation:
We continue to invest heavily in digital capabilities. Our digital insurance sales now account for 45% of total premiums in BAGIC and 52% in BALIC. The digital-first approach has helped us reduce customer acquisition costs by 15% year-on-year.

ESG and Sustainability:
We've launched several green finance products through our subsidiaries. BAGIC introduced climate-resilient insurance products for farmers, while BALIC launched ESG-focused ULIP schemes. Our carbon-neutral operations target remains on track for FY25.

Market Expansion:
We opened 127 new touchpoints across our insurance businesses during the quarter, taking our total distribution network to 2,847 branches. Our rural and semi-urban market penetration strategy is showing strong traction with 38% of new customers coming from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE:

For FY25, we maintain our guidance of:
• Total income growth of 12-15%
• PAT growth of 12-15%
• ROE to remain above 25%
• Dividend payout ratio of 15-20%

The insurance sector is expected to grow at 12-15% CAGR over the next three years, driven by increased awareness, regulatory support, and digitalization. We are well-positioned to capture this growth through our strong brand, distribution network, and product innovation capabilities.

ANALYST Q&A SESSION:

Analyst 1: What is your strategy for maintaining growth momentum in the insurance business given increasing competition?

Management: Our strategy focuses on three pillars: product innovation, distribution expansion, and digital adoption. We're launching 15 new insurance products in FY25, including cyber insurance and parametric covers. Our bancassurance partnerships are being strengthened, and we're investing in AI-driven underwriting and claims processing.

Analyst 2: How do you see the regulatory changes in the insurance sector impacting your business?

Management: The recent regulatory changes, particularly the increased FDI limit and motor insurance reforms, are positive for the industry. They will bring more capital, increase competition, and ultimately benefit consumers. Our strong market position and operational efficiency give us confidence in navigating these changes successfully.

Analyst 3: What are your plans for the asset management business?

Management: Our asset management business is scaling rapidly with AUM crossing ₹18,000 crores. We're focusing on alternative investment products and retail mutual fund distribution. We expect this business to contribute 8-10% of our total income by FY26.

Analyst 4: Can you provide insights on the health insurance segment growth?

Management: Health insurance is our fastest-growing segment with premiums up 28% YoY. Post-pandemic awareness has significantly increased demand. We've introduced family floater plans with coverage up to ₹1 crore and are expanding our hospital network partnerships. This segment now contributes 32% of BAGIC's total premiums.

CLOSING REMARKS:

In conclusion, Q2 FY25 has been another strong quarter for Bajaj Finserv. Our diversified business model, strong balance sheet, and strategic focus on profitable growth position us well for the future. We remain committed to delivering consistent returns to our shareholders while building a sustainable and resilient business.

The Indian financial services sector offers tremendous opportunities, and we are confident about capturing our fair share of this growth. Thank you for your continued confidence in Bajaj Finserv.
